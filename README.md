**Introduction**. 

Hello, I am Vishwas Nawal, a second year Software Engineering major. 

I am really interested in full-stack development, and AI/ML. I am someone who is a firm believer in that we should create tech for good rather than a business model.

I would love to collaborate on tech that solves real life problem. I have been very eager to solve problems that have impact at ground level from a young age. I am very excited to see what sorts of problems we can solve together.

Please feel free to [email](vnawal@uci.edu). You can also follow me on my GitHub to see what I am up to, and the projects that I am currently involved in. Please reach out to me if you need my phone number.

I am more than happy to talk with you on in person! Looking forward to seeing you soon in the future!
